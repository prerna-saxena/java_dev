Based on the "Access Control Overview" and the likely functionalities of the Retry & Replay Framework, here's a more detailed breakdown of the roles and their associated permissions:

1. System Administrator:

User Management:
CREATE_USER: Ability to create new user accounts.
READ_USER: Ability to view user details.
UPDATE_USER: Ability to modify user details (including roles).
DELETE_USER: Ability to deactivate or delete user accounts.
ASSIGN_ROLE: Ability to assign roles to users.
Global Configuration:
VIEW_GLOBAL_CONFIG: Ability to view global framework settings.
EDIT_GLOBAL_CONFIG: Ability to modify global framework settings (e.g., default notification settings, system-wide parameters).
Retry Configuration Management:
CREATE_RETRY_CONFIG: Ability to define new retry configurations for specific job/transaction types.
READ_RETRY_CONFIG: Ability to view existing retry configurations.
UPDATE_RETRY_CONFIG: Ability to modify existing retry configurations.
DELETE_RETRY_CONFIG: Ability to remove retry configurations.
ENABLE_RETRY_CONFIG: Ability to enable retry for a specific job/transaction type.
DISABLE_RETRY_CONFIG: Ability to disable retry for a specific job/transaction type.
Replay Management:
INITIATE_REPLAY: Ability to initiate replay operations for any failed transaction.
VIEW_REPLAY_STATUS: Ability to view the status of any replay attempt.
VIEW_REPLAY_HISTORY: Ability to view the history of all replay attempts.
CONFIGURE_REPLAY_PARAMETERS: Ability to configure replay parameters (scope, timing, potentially data overrides).
Dashboard Access:
VIEW_DASHBOARD: Ability to access and view the main dashboard.
Logging and Monitoring:
VIEW_LOGS: Ability to view application logs.
CONFIGURE_LOGGING: Ability to adjust logging levels and settings.
VIEW_MONITORING_DATA: Ability to access detailed monitoring information.
Incident Management Configuration:
CONFIGURE_INCIDENT_RULES: Ability to define rules for automatic incident creation on failures.
VIEW_INCIDENT_CONFIG: Ability to view the current incident creation rules.
2. Operations User:

Retry Monitoring:
VIEW_RETRY_STATUS: Ability to view the current status of jobs under retry.
VIEW_RETRY_HISTORY (Potentially limited): Ability to view the history of retry attempts (possibly for specific transaction types they are responsible for).
Replay Management:
INITIATE_REPLAY (Potentially limited): Ability to initiate replay operations for specific transaction types or systems they are authorized for. This limitation would need to be defined further (e.g., based on group membership or explicit permissions).
VIEW_REPLAY_STATUS: Ability to view the status of replay attempts they initiated or are relevant to their responsibilities.
VIEW_REPLAY_HISTORY (Potentially limited): Ability to view the history of replay attempts they initiated or are relevant to their responsibilities.
Dashboard Access:
VIEW_DASHBOARD: Ability to access and view the main dashboard (potentially with a filtered view relevant to their responsibilities).
Logging (Read-Only):
VIEW_LOGS (Potentially filtered): Ability to view logs relevant to the transactions or systems they manage.
Potentially:
ACKNOWLEDGE_FAILURE: Ability to acknowledge a failed transaction.
RESOLVE_FAILURE: Ability to mark a failed transaction as resolved (e.g., after successful replay or manual correction).
3. Read-Only User/Monitor:

Dashboard Access:
VIEW_DASHBOARD: Ability to access and view the main dashboard.
Retry Monitoring:
VIEW_RETRY_STATUS: Ability to view the current status of jobs under retry.
VIEW_RETRY_HISTORY: Ability to view the history of retry attempts.
Replay Monitoring:
VIEW_REPLAY_STATUS: Ability to view the status of replay attempts.
VIEW_REPLAY_HISTORY: Ability to view the history of replay attempts.
Logging (Read-Only):
VIEW_LOGS: Ability to view application logs.
Implementation Notes:

Permissions should be granular enough to provide the necessary level of control without being overly complex to manage.
The backend implementation (likely using Spring Security) will enforce these permissions on API endpoints and service methods.
The UI should be dynamically rendered based on the user's roles and permissions, hiding or disabling features they are not authorized to use.
Consider using a consistent naming convention for permissions (e.g., ACTION_RESOURCE).
The mapping between roles and permissions should be configurable and potentially stored in a database or configuration file.
Auditing of permission checks and access attempts can be valuable for security and troubleshooting.
This detailed breakdown provides a solid foundation for implementing role-based access control in the Retry & Replay Framework. The specific needs of the application and its users will ultimately dictate the final set of roles and permissions.
