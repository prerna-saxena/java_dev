Elaborate Documentation Content (Within docs/ and README.md)
Your documentation should be comprehensive and cover all aspects of the framework. Here's a breakdown of what should be included in each file:

1. README.md (Project Root)

Project Title: Clear and concise name (e.g., Chubb Retry & Replay Framework).
Overview: A brief summary of the project's purpose and key features.
Key Technologies Used: List the main technologies (Spring Boot, Quartz, Apache Camel, Kafka (if implemented), etc.).
Setup Instructions: Detailed steps on how to build and run the application locally. This should include:
Prerequisites (Java version, Maven, Kafka setup if used, email server configuration if needed).
Steps to clone the repository.
Maven build commands (mvn clean install).
Instructions on running the Spring Boot application.
Quick Start Guide: Basic instructions on how to use the framework (e.g., configuring a retry job, replaying a transaction through the UI).
Contribution Guidelines: If you intend for others to contribute (even if it's just for evaluation), outline how they can do so.
License: (Optional, but good practice).
2. docs/architecture.md (System Architecture)

High-Level Diagram: A visual representation of the framework's components and their interactions. This could include:
Job Scheduler (Spring Boot/Quartz)
Retry Manager
Replay Manager
UI
Logging Service
Notification Service
(Optional) Kafka Broker
Target Integrated Systems (represented abstractly)
Component Descriptions: Detailed explanation of each component's responsibility and functionality.
Data Flow: How data moves through the system during retry and replay processes.
Technology Stack: A more detailed list of the specific libraries and frameworks used for each component.
3. docs/design-decisions.md (Rationale Behind Key Choices)

Retry Mechanism Strategy Selection: Explain why you chose Spring Boot, Quartz, and Apache Camel for the job scheduling and integration aspects. Discuss the pros and cons of these technologies in the context of the requirements.
Retry Strategy Implementation: Detail your approach to implementing the different retry strategies (Fixed Interval, Exponential Backoff, Circuit Breaker, Jitter). Explain how you've made them configurable.
Event-Driven Retries (if implemented): If you used Kafka, explain the design of your event-driven retry mechanism. How are events produced and consumed? What is the message format?
Replay Process Design: Describe the logic behind selecting, validating, and replaying transactions. Explain how you handle stateful and stateless replays. Discuss the configurability of the replay process.
UI/UX Considerations: Outline the design principles behind your user interface and how you aimed for intuitiveness.
Logging and Monitoring Strategy: Explain your approach to structured logging and the use of correlation IDs.
Notification Mechanism: Detail how the email notification service works and how email templates are managed.
Authentication and Authorization: Explain your role-based access control implementation.
4. docs/api-documentation.md (API Documentation)

If your framework exposes any APIs (e.g., for external systems to trigger retries or manage configurations programmatically), document them here. Use a standard format like OpenAPI (Swagger) or provide clear descriptions of endpoints, request/response formats, and authentication methods.
5. docs/user-guide.md (User Manual for the UI)

Provide step-by-step instructions on how to use the web-based UI. This should include:
Accessing the UI.
Navigating the dashboard.
Monitoring transaction statuses.
Configuring retry jobs (defining intervals, limits, strategies).
Selecting transactions for replay.
Configuring replay parameters (scope, timing).
Viewing logs and reports.
Managing user roles and permissions.
6. docs/developer-guide.md (Setup, Build, and Contribution Guidelines)

More detailed instructions for developers who might want to understand the codebase or contribute. This could include:
Code style guidelines.
Testing strategy (unit, integration tests).
Debugging tips.
How to add new retry strategies or replay mechanisms.
Contribution workflow (e.g., using pull requests).
7. docs/deployment.md (Deployment Instructions)

Outline how the framework can be deployed in different environments (e.g., local development, staging, production). This might include considerations for:
Database configuration (if you persist retry/replay metadata).
Kafka broker details (if used).
Email server setup.
Security considerations.
8. docs/future-enhancements.md (Potential Future Improvements)

Discuss potential future features or improvements for the framework. This shows forward-thinking and a deeper understanding of the problem domain. Examples could include:
More sophisticated retry strategies (e.g., adaptive backoff).
Integration with monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana).
More advanced reporting and analytics.
Support for different messaging systems.
More granular access control.
Code Structure and Implementation Considerations:

Modularity: Design your code in a modular way, separating concerns for scheduling, retry logic, replay logic, UI, logging, and notifications.
Configuration: Make the framework highly configurable through properties files or a dedicated configuration mechanism. This includes retry intervals, limits, strategies, email settings, etc.
Error Handling: Implement robust error handling within the framework itself.
Testing: Write comprehensive unit and integration tests to ensure the reliability of your retry and replay mechanisms.
User Interface (UI): Focus on creating an intuitive and user-friendly web interface. Use clear labels, provide informative feedback, and make it easy for users to monitor and manage retries and replays.
Logging: Implement structured logging with correlation IDs to easily track transactions across different parts of the system. Include relevant information in your logs (timestamp, transaction ID, retry attempts, status, errors).
Notification Service: Ensure the email notification service is reliable and that email templates are clear and informative. Consider options for configuring notification rules.
Security: Implement role-based authentication to protect access to the retry and replay features. Consider other security best practices.
Evaluation Focus:

Remember that your submission will be evaluated based on the criteria mentioned:

Technical Feasibility: How well does your solution implement the core retry and replay logic?
Scalability & Performance: How efficiently can your framework handle a large number of transactions and retry attempts? Consider the design choices that contribute to scalability.
Code Quality & Best Practices: Is your code clean, well-organized, maintainable, and adheres to Java best practices? Is it well-documented within the code itself (comments)?
UI/UX Experience: Is the user interface intuitive, easy to navigate, and provides a good user experience?
Logging & Monitoring Implementation: Is your logging structured, informative, and does it facilitate easy tracing of transactions?
