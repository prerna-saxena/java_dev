a comprehensive solution for the Retry & Replay Framework as outlined in the Chubb hackathon challenge. 
While I don't have a specific GitHub repository or deployed link to provide, 
I can guide you on how to build such a framework using existing resources and best practices.

Building the Retry & Replay Framework
1. Retry Mechanism
Spring Retry: Utilize Spring Retry to implement retry logic with annotations like @Retryable and @Recover. This allows for declarative retry policies, including fixed and exponential backoff strategies. ​
GitHub

Apache Camel: Leverage Apache Camel's routing capabilities to define retry routes and integrate with various endpoints.​

Quartz Scheduler: Incorporate Quartz to schedule retries at configurable intervals.​

Kafka Integration: For event-driven retries, integrate Kafka to handle message retries and dead-letter queues. ​
GitHub

2. Replay Process
Manual Replay UI: Develop a web interface allowing users to select and replay failed transactions.​

Validation and Context Adherence: Ensure that replays adhere to system validations and context requirements.​

Stateful and Stateless Replays: Support both types to handle various transaction scenarios.​

Configurable Parameters: Allow users to define the scope (specific systems, transaction types) and timing (immediate or scheduled) for replays.​

3. User Interface & Access Control
Web-Based UI: Build using Spring Boot and Thymeleaf for intuitive interaction.​

Role-Based Authentication: Implement using Spring Security to ensure secure access to features.​

Dashboard: Provide real-time monitoring of transaction statuses, retry attempts, and replay outcomes.​

4. Logging & Monitoring
Structured Logging: Integrate with correlation IDs for traceability across services.​

Detailed Logs: Maintain comprehensive logs of retry attempts, replay executions, and their outcomes.​

5. Notification Management
Automated Notifications: Configure to send email alerts upon completion of retries or replays.​

Customizable Templates: Allow customization of email templates for better communication.​

Incident Creation: Provide options to create incidents in case of persistent failures.​



Code Snippets
Retryable Service Method
java

@Service
public class MyService {

    @Retryable(
        value = { RemoteServiceNotAvailableException.class },
        maxAttempts = 5,
        backoff = @Backoff(delay = 2000, multiplier = 2))
    public void callRemoteService() {
        // Logic to call remote service
    }

    @Recover
    public void recover(RemoteServiceNotAvailableException e) {
        // Recovery logic
    }
}
Quartz Job for Retry
java
public class RetryJob implements Job {
    @Override
    public void execute(JobExecutionContext context) throws JobExecutionException {
        // Logic to perform retry
    }
}

Apache Camel Route
java
 
from("direct:start")
    .onException(Exception.class)
        .maximumRedeliveries(3)
        .redeliveryDelay(1000)
        .backOffMultiplier(2)
        .retryAttemptedLogLevel(LoggingLevel.WARN)
    .end()
    .to("bean:myService?method=callRemoteService");
