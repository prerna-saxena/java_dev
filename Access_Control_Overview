The Access Control for this Retry & Replay Framework project will be implemented using Role-Based Authentication to ensure secure access to its features. This means that users will be assigned specific roles, and these roles will determine the actions they are authorized to perform within the system.

Here's an overview of the Access Control implementation:

1. User Roles:

We envision at least the following roles, although the specific roles and their permissions can be further细化 based on the detailed requirements and potential user groups:

System Administrator:

Full Access: Has complete control over the entire framework.
Permissions:
Manage user accounts and roles.
Configure global framework settings (e.g., default retry policies, notification settings).
Define and manage retry job configurations (intervals, limits, strategies) for all transaction types and systems.
Initiate and manage replay operations for all transaction types and systems.
Monitor the overall health and status of the framework.
Access all logs and reports.
Configure incident creation rules.
Operations User:

Limited Access to Replay and Monitoring: Primarily focused on managing failed transactions.
Permissions:
View the dashboard and monitor transaction statuses.
View details of failed transactions.
Select and initiate replay operations for specific transaction types or systems (based on further defined permissions).
View logs and reports related to replay attempts.
Potentially acknowledge or resolve failed transactions.
Read-Only User/Monitor:

View Access Only: Can monitor the system but cannot make any changes or initiate actions.
Permissions:
View the dashboard and transaction statuses.
View retry and replay history.
Access logs and reports (potentially read-only).
2. Authentication:

The framework will require users to authenticate themselves (i.e., prove their identity) before accessing any protected features.
This will likely involve a standard username/password-based login mechanism integrated with the Web-Based UI.
Future enhancements could include integration with existing enterprise authentication systems (e.g., LDAP, Active Directory) or the use of other authentication methods (e.g., multi-factor authentication).
Spring Security will likely be the chosen framework for handling authentication within the Spring Boot application.
3. Authorization:

Once a user is authenticated, the system needs to determine what actions they are authorized to perform. This is where role-based access control comes into play.
Each user will be assigned one or more roles.
Permissions will be associated with these roles.
When a user attempts to access a specific feature or perform an action (e.g., configure a retry job, initiate a replay), the system will check if their assigned role(s) have the necessary permission.
Spring Security provides robust mechanisms for implementing role-based authorization using annotations (e.g., @PreAuthorize("hasRole('ADMIN')")) or configuration.
4. UI-Based Access Control:

The Web-Based UI will be designed to reflect the access control policies. Users will only see the features and options that their roles allow them to interact with.
For example, an "Operations User" might see the list of failed transactions and the "Replay" button but might not have access to the "Configuration" or "User Management" sections that are visible to a "System Administrator."
5. Backend API Security:

The backend RESTful APIs (if any) that the UI interacts with will also be secured using the same role-based authorization mechanism. This prevents unauthorized access to backend functionalities even if a user were to bypass the UI.
6. Audit Logging:

All authentication attempts, authorization decisions (especially failed attempts), and significant actions performed within the framework (e.g., configuration changes, replay initiations) will be logged for auditing and security purposes.
Implementation Considerations:

A mechanism will be needed to manage users and their assigned roles (e.g., an administrative interface accessible only to "System Administrators").
The roles and their associated permissions should be clearly defined and documented.
The access control implementation should be robust and prevent unauthorized access to sensitive functionalities and data.
By implementing Role-Based Access Control, the Retry & Replay Framework can ensure that only authorized personnel can manage and interact with its features, contributing to the security and stability of the overall system.
