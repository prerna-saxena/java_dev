Here's a conceptual overview of the API endpoints that the Retry & Replay Framework might expose, along with sample request and response payloads. These are illustrative and might evolve based on the specific implementation. The API will likely be RESTful, using JSON for request and response bodies.

Base URL: Assuming the application runs on http://localhost:8080, the API endpoints would typically be under a specific path, e.g., /api/v1.

    "level": "INFO",
    "message": "Replay initiated for transaction txn-789."
  }
]
5. Authentication and Authorization Endpoints:

These are typically handled by Spring Security and might involve standard login (POST /login) and potentially user management endpoints (if the framework manages its own users). The specifics depend on the chosen authentication mechanism.
Security Considerations:

All API endpoints should be secured using appropriate authentication and authorization mechanisms (e.g., JWT tokens, session-based authentication, role-based access control as discussed earlier).
Sensitive operations (like initiating replay with data overrides) should have strict authorization checks.
Input validation should be performed on all request payloads to prevent security vulnerabilities.
This list provides a starting point for the API design. The actual endpoints and their payloads will be determined by the specific features and functionalities implemented in the Retry & Replay Framework. Remember to document these APIs thoroughly (e.g., using OpenAPI/Swagger specifications).
