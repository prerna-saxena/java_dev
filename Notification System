The Notification System for this Retry & Replay Framework is designed to keep relevant stakeholders informed about the outcomes of retry and replay processes, as well as critical failure scenarios. Here's a breakdown of its features and implementation considerations:

Core Functionality:

Automated Email Alerts: The primary mechanism for notification will be sending email alerts.
Configurable Email Templates: The content and format of the email notifications will be customizable.
Trigger Points: Notifications will be triggered by specific events within the framework.
Recipient Management: The system will need to determine the appropriate recipients for each notification.
Optional Incident Creation: For critical failures, the system will provide an option to automatically create incidents in an external Incident Management System.
Trigger Points for Notifications:

Retry Completion (Success): When a failed transaction is successfully retried.
Retry Completion (Failure - Max Attempts Reached): When all configured retry attempts for a transaction have failed.
Replay Completion (Success): When a manually replayed transaction is successful.
Replay Completion (Failure): When a manually replayed transaction fails.
Persistent Failure (Optional): If a transaction continues to fail after multiple retries and replays, a notification could be sent to escalate the issue.
Circuit Breaker State Change: When a circuit breaker transitions to an open or closed state.
Configuration Changes (Optional): Notifications for significant configuration changes to the retry or replay mechanisms (for auditing).
Email Notification Features:

Configurable Templates: The system will use a template engine (e.g., Thymeleaf) to allow administrators to customize the content, subject, and format of email notifications. Templates can include details like:
Transaction ID
Job Identifier
Status (Success/Failure)
Number of retry attempts
Failure reason (if available)
Timestamp of the event
Link to the Retry & Replay Framework UI for more details.
Recipient Determination: The system will need a mechanism to determine who should receive notifications for specific events. This could be based on:
Configuration per Job/Transaction Type: Administrators can specify email addresses or distribution lists for notifications related to certain types of transactions.
User Roles: Notifications might be sent to users with specific roles (e.g., "Operations User" for replay failures, "System Administrator" for critical system issues).
Subscription Model (Optional): Users might be able to subscribe to notifications for specific transaction types or systems.
Asynchronous Sending: Email sending should be handled asynchronously to avoid blocking the main processing flow of the retry and replay mechanisms. This can be achieved using Spring's @Async annotation or a message queue.
Logging of Notifications: The system should log all sent notifications, including the recipient, subject, and status (success/failure of sending).
Error Handling: Robust error handling should be implemented for email sending failures (e.g., due to SMTP server issues). Potentially, a retry mechanism for sending emails could be considered.
Incident Creation (Optional):

For critical failure scenarios (e.g., max retry attempts reached, repeated replay failures), the Notification System can be configured to automatically create incidents in an external Incident Management System (e.g., Jira, ServiceNow).
This would require integration with the API of the target Incident Management System.
Configuration would involve defining the conditions under which an incident should be created and mapping relevant information (e.g., transaction ID, failure reason) to the fields of the incident.
Similar to email notifications, incident creation should be handled asynchronously to avoid blocking.
Logging of incident creation attempts (success/failure) is important.
Implementation Details:

Spring Mail: Spring Boot provides excellent support for sending emails using the JavaMail API.
Template Engine (e.g., Thymeleaf): For creating dynamic and configurable email content.
Configuration: Notification settings (SMTP server details, email templates, recipient mappings, incident management system details) should be configurable through the application.properties or application.yml file or a dedicated configuration interface in the UI.
Event-Driven Approach: The Notification System can subscribe to internal events within the Retry & Replay Framework (e.g., "RetrySucceededEvent," "ReplayFailedEvent") to trigger notifications. Spring's Application Events can be used for this purpose.
User Interface Integration:

The UI could provide a section for administrators to configure email templates and recipient mappings.
Users might be able to view a history of sent notifications.
By implementing a robust Notification System, the Retry & Replay Framework can proactively communicate important events, enabling timely intervention and resolution of issues, ultimately improving the reliability and maintainability of the integrated systems.
