Objective of the Retry & Replay Framework Project
The primary objective of this hackathon project is to design and develop a robust, scalable, and user-friendly Retry & Replay Framework using Java, Spring Boot, Quartz, and Apache Camel (with optional Kafka integration). This framework aims to enhance the reliability of business operations by:

Intelligently managing transient failures in integrated systems.
Automating retry mechanisms with configurable strategies and scheduling.
Providing a manual replay mechanism for error correction and data recovery.
Ultimately, the goal is to empower businesses to build more resilient applications that can gracefully handle system disruptions and ensure data integrity without significant manual intervention.

Key Features of the Retry & Replay Framework
The framework will provide the following key features:

1. Configurable Retry Mechanism:

Job Scheduling: Utilizing Spring Boot and Quartz for defining and scheduling retry jobs.
Configurable Retry Intervals and Attempt Limits: Allowing users to define how often and how many times a failed transaction should be retried.
Multiple Retry Strategies:
Fixed Interval: Retrying at a consistent time interval.
Exponential Backoff: Dynamically increasing the wait time between retries.
Circuit Breaker: Preventing excessive retries when a system is likely down.
Jitter: Introducing randomness to retry intervals to avoid retry storms.
Intelligent Strategy Selection: Enabling the system to choose the most appropriate retry strategy based on the nature of the failure (potentially through configuration or basic analysis).
Event-Driven Retries (Optional): Leveraging Kafka to trigger retries based on events, allowing for decoupled and reactive retry mechanisms.
2. Manual Replay Process:

User Interface for Selection: Providing a web-based UI for users to identify and select failed transactions for replay.
Validation and Context Adherence: Ensuring that the replay process respects necessary validations and system context to maintain data integrity.
Stateful and Stateless Replay Support: Handling different types of transactions, whether they rely on prior system state or can be replayed independently.
Configurable Replay Parameters: Allowing users to define the scope (specific systems, transaction types) and timing (immediate or scheduled) of the replay.
3. User Interface & Access Control:

Web-Based UI: A user-friendly interface for system administrators and authorized users.
Role-Based Authentication: Secure access to the framework's features based on user roles.
Intuitive Dashboard: A central view to monitor transaction statuses, trigger retries, and access relevant reports.
4. Logging & Monitoring:

Structured Logging: Implementing clear and structured logs using Spring Boot's logging framework.
Correlation IDs: Tracking transactions across different components using correlation IDs for better traceability.
Detailed Logs: Maintaining records of retry attempts, replay executions, and their outcomes.
5. Notification Management:

Automated Email Alerts: Sending email notifications upon the completion (success or failure) of retry and replay processes.
Configurable Email Templates: Allowing customization of email content for better communication.
Incident Creation Option: Providing an option to automatically create incidents in an external system upon persistent failures.
In essence, this project aims to deliver a comprehensive and adaptable solution for managing failures in distributed systems, improving overall system resilience and operational efficiency.
